# Perceptron

Proposed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1943, later refined and carefully analyzed by Minsky and Papert in 1969.

The perceptron model is a more general computational model than McCulloch-Pitts neuron. 
It takes an input, aggregates it (weighted sum) and returns 1 only if the aggregated sum is more than some threshold else returns 0.

This program detects the clicks on the canvas, marking each one and classifying with the perceptron. Finally we can draw a degraded on the canvas.
